## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+
- Git installed on your system

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sharmaniraj009/gitvisualizer.git
cd gitvisualizer
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development servers:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts both the backend (port 3001) and frontend (port 5173).

4. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

### Running Individually

```bash
npm run dev:backend   # Start only backend
npm run dev:frontend  # Start only frontend
```

## Visualizing the repo

1. Add the absolute path of the folder containing the ```.git``` folder and voila! 

### 
Additionaly you can also input the github/gitlab url in the input bar on index page. or simple add ```http://localhost:<port>/github.com/<user>/<repo>```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
PORT=3001                    # Backend server port (optional)
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token      # GitHub personal access token for private repos (optional)
```
